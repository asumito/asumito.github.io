# A redesign of my personal [domain](asumito.com)

## Asmit's Personal Website

### Project Overview

This is my personal website, designed to serve as a digital portfolio and a central hub for my projects and thoughts. The site features a clean, modern, and responsive user interface to ensure it looks great on any device.

## Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** The layout automatically adjusts for optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

* **Modern UI/UX:** The design incorporates a dark theme, smooth hover effects, and subtle animations for a polished look and feel.

* **Modular Codebase:** The project is organized into separate files (`.html`, `.css`, and `.js`) for easy management and scalability.

* **Clean & Organized:** A minimalist design that focuses on readability and user experience.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the website.

* **CSS3:** For styling and visual presentation.

* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for utility-first styling directly within the HTML, making development faster and more consistent.

* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and smooth scrolling.

## Change Log

This log documents the major changes and reasoning behind them throughout the development process.

### V1.0 - Initial Single-File Creation

* **What I did:** Created a complete, single-file HTML page.

* **Rationale:** This was the first draft to quickly visualize the design suggestions and ensure the core layout and styling were correct. It's a great way to prototype an idea rapidly.

### V1.1 - Split into Separate Files

* **What I did:** Refactored the code into three separate files:

    * `index.html`: Contains only the HTML structure.

    * `styles.css`: Contains the custom CSS, including animations and the profile picture glow effect.

    * `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript for interactive features like smooth scrolling.

* **Rationale:** This change was made to follow modern web development best practices. Separating concerns makes the code easier to read, debug, and maintain. This structure is ideal for hosting the project on platforms like GitHub Pages.
